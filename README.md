## Test String Generator for Turing Machine Coursework

This C++ script generates valid test strings in the format:


All generated output is written directly to `test.txt`.

---

## How to Run

You can run the script using CLion, or directly through a terminal (requires **gcc** or **clang**).

### Using gcc

```bash
g++ main.cpp -o gen && ./gen
````

```bash
clang++ main.cpp -o gen && ./gen
```
You can then load the file in JFLAP through the Multiple Run (Transducer) option and run the tests.

You can modify the length of the test strings generated by changing the mod value for len1 and len2 in the source code.

``` c++
int len1 = rand() % 3;
int len2 = rand() % 3;
```

Using a higher value will prompt JFLAP to ask you whether you want to continue for longer tests which can get tedious to click through.
